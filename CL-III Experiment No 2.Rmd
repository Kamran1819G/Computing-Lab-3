#### **Aim:** R program to Implement Vector, Dataframe, Matrix, List and Array operations.

#### **Theory:**

#### Vector:

R Vectors are the same as the arrays in R language which are used to hold multiple data values of the same type. One major key point is that in R Programming Language the indexing of the vector will start from ‘1’ and not from ‘0’. We can create numeric vectors and character vectors as well.

```{r}
numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
char_vector <- c("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi")

# Basic operations
result_addition <- numeric_vector + 2
result_multiplication <- numeric_vector * 3

# Display results
print(result_addition)
print(result_multiplication)
```
#### Matrix:
A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure where data are arranged into rows and columns.

```{r}
# Create a matrix
my_matrix <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# Matrix operations
matrix_product <- my_matrix %*% my_matrix
determinant_value <- det(my_matrix)

# Display results
print(matrix_product)
print(determinant_value)
```
#### Dataframe:
A data frame is a two-dimensional data structure which can store data in tabular format.

Data frames have rows and columns and each column can be a different vector. And different vectors can be of different data types.

```{r}
# Create a dataframe
my_dataframe <- data.frame(Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob"),
                           Age = c(25, 30, 28),
                           Grade = c("A", "B", "C"))

# Add a new row
new_row <- c("Eva", 22, "A")
my_dataframe <- rbind(my_dataframe, new_row)

# Subset and filter
subset_dataframe <- my_dataframe[my_dataframe$Age > 25, ]

# Display results
print(my_dataframe)
print(subset_dataframe)
```
#### List:
A List is a collection of similar or different types of data.

In R, we use the `list()` function to create a list.

```{r}
# Create a list
my_list <- list(numbers = c(1, 2, 3), characters = c("apple", "banana", "orange"), logicals = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))

# Access and modify elements
my_list$numbers[2] <- 5

# Display results
print(my_list)
print(length(my_list))
str(my_list)
```

#### Array:
An Array is a data structure which can store data of the same type in more than two dimensions.

The only difference between vectors, matrices, and arrays are

- Vectors are uni-dimensional arrays
- Matrices are two-dimensional arrays
- Arrays can have more than two dimensions

```{r}
# Create a 2D array for temperature data
temperature_data <- array(data = c(23, 28, 24, 29, 26, 30, 21, 25, 22, 27, 29, 31),
                          dim = c(3, 4),
                          dimnames = list(c("City_A", "City_B", "City_C"), c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr")))

# Calculate average temperature for each city
average_city_temperature <- apply(temperature_data, 1, mean)

# Calculate overall average temperature
overall_average_temperature <- mean(temperature_data)

# Display results
print(temperature_data)
print(average_city_temperature)
print(overall_average_temperature)
```

#### **Conclusion**:
Through this experiment we have studied about implementation of Vector, Matrix, Dataframe, List and Array in R programming.
