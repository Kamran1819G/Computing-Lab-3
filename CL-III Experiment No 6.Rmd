#### **Aim:** To implement different conditional statements in R programming language.

#### **Theory:**
Conditional statements are fundamental constructs in programming languages, enabling the execution of specific code blocks based on given conditions. In R programming, we encounter various types of conditional statements:

1. **if-else statement:**
It evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true. If the condition is false, it executes another block of code.

```{r}
x <- 10
if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5")
} else {
  print("x is less than or equal to 5")
}
```

2. **if-else if-else statement:**
This statement allows us to check multiple conditions sequentially. It provides flexibility in handling various scenarios based on different conditions.

```{r}
y <- 7
if (y < 5) {
  print("y is less than 5")
} else if (y == 5) {
  print("y is equal to 5")
} else {
  print("y is greater than 5")
}
```

3. **switch statement:**
The switch statement provides an efficient way to select one of many alternative blocks of code to be executed based on the value of a variable.

```{r}
z <- "apple"
switch(z,
       "apple" = print("It's a fruit"),
       "car" = print("It's a vehicle"),
       "cat" = print("It's an animal"),
       print("Not recognized")
)
```

4. **for loop:**
Loops are used to iterate over a sequence of elements. The for loop in R allows executing a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times.

```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(paste("Iteration:", i))
}
```

#### **Conclusion**: 
In this experiment, we explored different conditional statements and a for loop in R programming language. These constructs are essential for controlling the flow of execution and iterating over elements in a program.
